# Exercise: Vehicle Rental System

**Objective:**  
Develop a vehicle rental system using Java, focusing on implementing interfaces, inheritance, exceptions, collections, and file I/O.

## Requirements

1. **Define Interfaces:**
    - Create an interface to define the basic operations for renting vehicles, such as calculating rental prices, renting a vehicle, and returning it.

2. **Define Abstract and Concrete Classes:**
    - Implement an abstract base class for vehicles with common properties (e.g., license plate, rental status).
    - Create several concrete vehicle classes (e.g., Car, Bike, Truck) that extend the abstract class and provide specific implementations.

3. **Exception Handling:**
    - Create at least two custom exception to handle different scenarios.

4. **Implement a Rental Manager:**
    - Develop a manager class to handle vehicle operations, such as adding/removing vehicles, renting/returning vehicles, and calculating total rental income.

5. **File I/O:**
    - Implement methods to save and load vehicle data from a file to persist the rental information.

6. **Program Execution:**
    - Write a main method to demonstrate the functionality of your rental system, including adding vehicles, renting, returning, and file operations.
